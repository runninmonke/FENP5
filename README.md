myNeighborhood

myNeighborhood utilizes the Google Maps API to diplay a map of various places in the Midtown Omaha area and provide information about them.
Some additional weather and astronomical data is provided via a pair of additional APIs. A collapsable navigation bar provides a search field
that will filter the list of places on the map as the user types. The navigation bar also has a list view of the places that is updated
simultaneously. Hitting 'enter' resets the set of places being interacted with on the map with the results of a search in the Google Places API.
The original set of places can be reloaded with 'shift + enter'. There is also a button available for both functionalities.
